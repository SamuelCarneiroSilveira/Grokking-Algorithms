1. Binary search: Repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
<br> The speed of an algorithm is not measured in seconds, but rather by its gorwth, how the algorithm behaves as the number of interation grows.The execution time of algorithms is expressed by a notation called Big O. The binary search O(log n) is faster than the simple search O(n), and gets even faster as the number of elements in the list grows.
