Binary search

Repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one

Ex 1.1:
    If you need to determine how many searches are required to find an item among 128 options, you would calculate the logarithm of 128 in base 2, which results in 7
Ex 1.2:
    If you need to determine how many searches are required to find an item among 256 options, you would calculate the logarithm of 256 in base 2, which results in 8
Ex 1.3:
    O(log n)
Ex 1.4: 
    O(n)
Ex 1.5: 
    O(n)
Ex 1.6: 
    O(n)
